# Feature Enhancements

# Advanced Filtering and Reporting

## Filter Tasks
- Combine filters (e.g., all tasks assigned to me with high priority and due this week).
- Enable a search bar for quick lookup by task name or description.

## Dashboard and Analytics
- Create a dashboard to display stats like:
    - Number of tasks by status, priority, or user.
    - Average time to complete tasks.
    - Overdue tasks.

## Export Data
- Enable exporting tasks or reports in formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF.

# Improve Authentication and Authorization

## OAuth2
- Add integration with Google, GitHub, or Microsoft for user authentication.
- Use OAuth scopes to limit access to certain API endpoints.

## JWT Enhancements
- Add token refresh functionality.
- Implement token revocation for added security.

---

# Performance and Scalability

## Caching
- Use Redis or a similar caching mechanism for frequently accessed data like task lists.
- Cache JWT tokens for faster authentication.


## Batch Processing
- Allow batch creation, updating, or deletion of tasks.
    - Example: Update statuses for multiple tasks in one API call.


## Task Scheduler 
- Use `@Scheduled` to send daily task reminders or overdue task alerts.


## Docker
- Containerize your application for easy deployment.
- Use Docker Compose to manage Spring Boot and MySQL together.


## Microservices
- Split the app into microservices (e.g., Auth Service, Task Service) to learn about distributed systems.

## GraphQL API
- Implement GraphQL for more flexible queries and better client-side performance.

## Messaging System
- Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for task notification events to decouple services.

---

# Real-World Practices

## Audit Logs
- Track changes made to tasks (who modified what and when).

## Versioning
- Add versioning to APIs to manage backward compatibility.

## Error Handling
- Centralize error handling for cleaner and more consistent error responses.

## Security Enhancements
- Add rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
- Enable SSL for secure communication.

---

# Bonus

## AI Integration
- Use OpenAI's APIs to auto-suggest task descriptions or priorities based on inputs.
    - Example: Generate subtasks for a given task description.

## External API Integration
- Sync tasks with tools like Google Calendar, Trello, or Asana.
