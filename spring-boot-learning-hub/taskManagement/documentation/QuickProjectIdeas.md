# Realistic Projects to Prepare for Java and Spring Boot Interviews

## 1. Task Management Application

### Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Implement basic create, read, update, and delete functionality using Spring Boot and JPA.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Use Spring Security with JWT for user authentication and role-based access.
- **Database Integration**: Use PostgreSQL (or H2 for simplicity) to store task data (title, description, due date,
  status, priority).
- **REST API**: Expose endpoints for managing tasks, including filtering by status and sorting by priority or due date.
- **Validation**: Add data validation using Hibernate Validator (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`).
- **Exception Handling**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` for global error handling.

### Tech Stack

- Spring Boot, JPA, PostgreSQL/H2, Spring Security, JWT, Spring Validation, Spring REST

### Bonus

- Add email notifications for upcoming due dates using Spring Email or JavaMail.
